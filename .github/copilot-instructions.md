# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Status

This workspace (`d:\文档\研究`) is currently empty with no existing codebase. No specific patterns, conventions, or workflows have been established yet.

## Recommendations for Future Development

When adding code to this workspace:

- Establish clear project structure and document it here
- Define build, test, and deployment processes
- Set coding conventions and patterns
- Identify key integration points

## Update Instructions

As the project evolves, update this file with discovered patterns and conventions from the actual codebase.

Since no existing AI conventions were found in the workspace, this is a starting point.
